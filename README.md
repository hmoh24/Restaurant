# Restaurant

This is the 6th javascript project from theodinproject curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

The purpose of this project was to introduce and practice the use of webpack. This project provided a good introduction to webpack since I ran into problems when using it, and in solving those small problems that consistently arose, I feel much more confident using this technology for future projects. However, this project only covered the basics of webpack, and while it is enough to use at this stage, if I want to extract the most utility out of this technology, I have to plan some extra learning.
